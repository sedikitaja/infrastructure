# Pihole

This yaml file is based on [Digital Aloha's pihole container](https://github.com/digtalaloha/synology-docker-pihole-unbound/tree/main).

I'm planning to migrate my single existing bare metal pihole instance to two containerised instances for easier maintainence and future migrations. Adding the second finally gives me redundancy from one instance going down.
